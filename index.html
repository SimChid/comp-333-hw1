            What I want to do right now is create a header. That header will have the title for the
            webpage (StarTunes) on the left hand side, and then the rest of the elements as a right justified
            flex table. In order from left to right we will have:
            * Explore
            * Charts
            * Pricing
            * Sign in/up

            I think that I might want a flex box with two elements, and the element on the right hand side will
            be a flex box with everything except for the title. To start I'll create the two element flex box.
